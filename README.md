# 🎯 Random Name Picker

A lightweight, interactive web application built with **Python** and **Streamlit**. This tool allows users to manage a list of names, select a specific number of random winners, and track history—all while automatically removing picked names from the active pool.

## ✨ Features
- **Dynamic List Management:** Paste names directly into the sidebar.
- **Custom Pick Counts:** Choose exactly how many names to draw at once.
- **Smart Depletion:** Once a name is picked, it is removed from the active list to prevent duplicates.
- **Session History:** Toggle a history view to see everyone who has been picked so far.
- **One-Click Reset:** A "Delete All" feature to wipe the current list and history instantly.
- **Clean UI:** Responsive design that works on desktop and mobile browsers.
